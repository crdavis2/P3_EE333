# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to provide a collection of tasks to allow the student to demonstrate
proficiency in using advanced software tools â€” specifically NetBeans / CoolBeans and Unit Testing while
extending the scope of the simulation. For this document, NetBeans mean NetBeans/CoolBeans as
appropriate.

# General Discussion
The report you write is a major component of this assignment. Refer to your code as an appendix to the
report and include it (and the report) in the .zip file that you submit. It is important to craft the written
report from the data collected during development organized around the process described below. You will
need to keep track of your actions as you work through the assignment in order to have the needed
evidence. If you use a logging mechanism separate from the final report, include it as an appendix. The
written report should convey what you wanted to do, how you used NetBeans to accomplish this, and how
you interpreted the situation presented by the various modules of NetBeans. Note that your report should
contain evidence that you are able to use NetBeans efectively not merely contain statements making claims.
NetBeans is a multi-purpose IDE (integrated development environment) that provides a superior environment
for developing JAVA code along with other capabilities. There is extensive online documentation for
NetBeans. In this assignment, you are to demonstrate competency in using NetBeans by
- Creating Java Classes with JavaDoc style documentation
- Creating Unit tests for classes
- Refactoring code
- Using the debugger
- Creating a jar execution file
- Producing the JavaDoc web pages
